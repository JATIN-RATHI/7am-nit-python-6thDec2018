Scope of Variables
All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program.
This depends on where you have declared a variable.

The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier.
There are two basic scopes of variables in Python âˆ’

Global variables
Local variables

'''
#Example

total = 0 # This is global variable.
# Function definition is here
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Add both the parameters and return them."
   total = arg1 + arg2 # Here total is local variable.
   print ("Inside the function local total : ", total)
   return total

# Now you can call sum function
sum( 10, 20 )
print ("Outside the function global total : ", total)
